# My WriteTech Accelerator Portfolio

Welcome! This repository contains all my project work and deliverables from the **WriteTech Accelerator Program**.

Over the course of the bootcamp, I completed technical writing projects across various domains ‚Äî including API documentation, AI, DevOps, automation, and Web3 ‚Äî using modern documentation workflows and tools.

## üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª About Me

Hey, I‚Äôm Cammie,  a writing enthusiast with a background in Product Management.

I love turning complex ideas into content that‚Äôs clear, useful, and actually fun to read. This portfolio highlights the practical skills I‚Äôve built during the WriteTech Accelerator.
